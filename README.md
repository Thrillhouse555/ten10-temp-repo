## Note

For the purpose of this test/demo I will only build the test scripting for testing only the requirements below and not test the login function, CSS .etc (for instance the logo isn't showing which could be a bug).

Run test in terminal using - npm run cy:calctest

## Assignment

As a product owner, I want to build a responsive interest calculator web application.

- The application should provide options to choose the duration for interest calculation: Daily, Monthly, and Yearly.
- Users should be able to input the principal amount.
- Users should be able to select the interest rate from a predefined list of rates up to 15%.
- The application should calculate the correct interest based on the selected duration, principal amount, and interest rate.
- The application should display the calculated interest and the total amount including interest.
- All input fields (principal amount, interest rate, duration and consent) are mandatory.
- The application should inform the user if any field is left empty or not selected.
- For simplicity, the calculated interest and total amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
- The application should be responsive and user-friendly.
- Clear error messages should be displayed to guide users in case of missing or incorrect inputs.
